## Context
In 2018, there were 15 airplane accidents of varying severity each year, with over 500 deaths. Although airplane safety continues to increase each year, we are interested in knowing if this number can be reduced further. We plan to investigate this by predicting the severity of a crash based on crash details, and determining which factors weight the most heavily on the severity of an accident.

## Goals

Predict the severity of an airplane accident based on several features:
* Number of days since inspection
* Total safety complaints
* An estimation of how much control the pilot had during the incident
* Turbulence
* Cabin temperature
* Accident type
* Max elevation
* Number of prior violations
